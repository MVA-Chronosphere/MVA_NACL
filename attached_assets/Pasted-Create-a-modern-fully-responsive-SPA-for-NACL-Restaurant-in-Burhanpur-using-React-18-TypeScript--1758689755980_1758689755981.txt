Create a modern, fully responsive SPA for NACL Restaurant in Burhanpur using React 18 + TypeScript, styled with Tailwind CSS and animated with Framer Motion and GSAP ScrollTrigger, replicating the exact visual flow, parallax animations, and rustic organic aesthetic of Green Rebel (https://www.greenrebel.ca/ ) — no backend or database needed, pure frontend. Implement a sticky header with NACL logo, hamburger menu for mobile, and navigation links: Home, Menu, Order Lunch, NACL Bowl, About, Catering, Order Catering, FAQ, Let’s Connect — all with smooth hover transitions and underline indicators. The hero section must feature a full-screen background video or static image with sliding text overlays (“Don’t eat less. Just eat real.” → “Eat real. Feel real.”), paired with floating vegetable cutouts (carrots, beets, pumpkins) that animate vertically as users scroll — use GSAP ScrollTrigger to replicate Green Rebel’s data-0="top:-20%;" data-top-bottom="top:-80%;" behavior for each veggie, positioned precisely on left/right edges with subtle depth. Structure the main content into four chalkboard-style sections: 1) “NACL Menu” with tagline “The choice is easy when it’s real food. Eat real. Feel real.” + “Discover Menu” button; 2) “Planning a working lunch or event?” with text “Feel good about the food you’re ordering. Don’t hesitate to call us for any advice. We’re here to help you!” + “See catering menu” button; 3) “NACL Bowl” with description “We came up with a smart program that will help you do your part for the environment while saving 50 cents each time you purchase a fresh delicious NACL salad.” + “Learn more” button; 4) “About NACL” with origin story: “Once upon a time, our founders brought authentic flavors from Burhanpur’s heritage to create NACL — where real ingredients meet local tradition.” + “Read more” button — each section uses beige/kraft paper (#D7CCC8) backgrounds with subtle texture overlays, black text (#212121), and green accent buttons (#388E3C). Add floating produce illustrations (carrot top→bottom right, beet bottom→top left, pumpkin top→bottom right) and small icon graphics at section ends. Ensure 100% responsiveness: mobile hamburger menu slides in with animation, touch-friendly buttons, adaptive grid layouts, and lazy-loaded images. Use Framer Motion for page transitions and scroll-triggered fade-ins, with smooth scrolling between sections via anchor links. Footer includes NACL logo, social icons (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp), contact info (phone: +91 XXXX XXX XXX, email: naclburhanpur@example.com ), “Order online” CTA, and footer navigation links (Home, Menu, Catering, About, Contact, Privacy) — all styled to match Green Rebel’s earthy, handcrafted feel. Optimize performance with React.memo, code splitting, and minimal bundle size — the final site must feel like a direct clone of Green Rebel’s motion, layout, and emotional tone, but fully rebranded for NACL with Burhanpur’s culinary identity.
